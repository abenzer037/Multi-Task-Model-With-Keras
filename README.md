The model  have one input but two outputs. A few of the shallow layers will be shared between the two outputs, I have been also use a ResNet style skip connection in the model.
I  used TensorFlow as our machine learning framework. The project uses the Google Colab environment.

I have accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Introduction
Task 2: Create Dataset
Task 3: Dataset Generator
Task 4: Create Model
Task 5: Train the Model
Task 6: Final Predictions
